# ICME R Programming Summer Workshop
This workshop is intended to prime individuals on the fundamentals of R
programming. Prior programming experience *is* expected: this is _not_ a
first-time programmer's course, but rather a course for those who know how to
program already and are interested in learning R.

## Before the Workshop
Please read the Background Section after downloading the Course Materials.
